# Simple Dashboard - what is it?

Simple Dashboard is a mini-project written to bring into live a crazy vision of
*Phobjects*. Idea born on a PHPNW 2011 conference - or to be more precise,
on Saturday night, after few pints of free beer.

But to be honest it is really simple dashboard which allows you to display 
widgets from your local server and from external endpoints - it's all based 
on JSON.
